Figure caption: Test-time scaling improves the performance of the recurrent model from [Geiping et al. 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05171) on a [Winogrande](https://huggingface.co/datasets/allenai/winogrande) task. The model initially assigns higher log-likelihood to the incorrect completion, "jars". As the number of recurrent steps increases, it favors the correct completion, "glow sticks". This shift illustrates how allocating more compute at test time can reveal latent competence otherwise suppressed by computational bottlenecks.
